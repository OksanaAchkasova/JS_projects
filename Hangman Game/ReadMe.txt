Hangman is a word-guessing game. In this version of Hangman, the JavaScript program choose the random word and the human player guess letters. Each time the player guess a letter correctly, the program fill in blanks for each occurrence of the letter. When the player guesses a letter that isn't in the word, the program draws part of a stick-man for each wrong guess. For guessing the player has ten attempts. If the program completes the stickman before the player guesses the word, the game will be over and the player will lose.
