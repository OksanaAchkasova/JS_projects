There is a classic arcade game Snake. In this game, the player uses the keyboard to control a snake by directing its movement up, down, left or right. As the snake moves around the playing area, apples appear. When the snake reaches an apple, it eats the apple and grows longer. But if the snake hits a wall or runs into part of its own body, the game is over. The head of snake is green and then blue and yellow are alternated for the rest of the body.
