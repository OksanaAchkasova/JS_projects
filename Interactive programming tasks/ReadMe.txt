Interactive2. html:
There is a heading element in the html-page. The heading element is animated around the page, in a square (200x200 pixels) by using setInterval. Every time a player clicks the heading, it speeds up, making it harder and harder to click. The program keeps track of the number of times the heading has been clicked and updates the heading text so it shows this number. When the player has reached 10 clicks, animation is stoped and the text of the heading is changed to "You win" (""Вы победили).
